						// Spring Boot Architecture
		//Spring Boot Architecture has four layers:
		
		//Presentation Layer – Authentication & Json Translation (CONTROLLER)
				//		✔️ Performing authentication. 
				//		✔️ Converting JSON data into an object (and vice versa).
				//		✔️ Handling HTTP requests.
				//		✔️ Transfering authentication to the business layer.
		//Business Layer – Business Logic, Validation & Authorization (SERVICE)
				//		The Business layer communicates with both the Presentation layer and the Persistence Layer.
				//		✔️ Performing validation.
				//		✔️ Performing authorization.
				//		✔️ Handling the business logic and rules.
		//Persistence Layer – Storage Logic
				//		This layer is responsible for:
				//
				//			✔️ Containing storage logic.
				//
				//			✔️ Fetching objects and translating them into database rows (and vice versa).
		//Database Layer – Actual Database   

		// controller is responsible for handling the client request first
		// controller then call the appropiate service
		// service then class the repository

		//Annotation
				//@Controller : Annotated class indicates that it is a controller component, and mainly used at the presentation layer. 
				//@Service : It indicates annotated class is a Service component in the business layer. 
				// @Repository : You need to use this annotation within the persistence layer, this acts like database repository.
